# Orbit Simulator

Welcome to the **Orbit Simulator** project!

This Python project generates random orbital parameters for celestial bodies. It prints out the semi-major axis (in astronomical units), eccentricity, and an estimated orbital period (in years) using a basic application of Kepler's Third Law.

## Features
- Generates random orbital parameters
- Simple, clean, and easy-to-read Python code
- A fun way to explore basic concepts in astronomy

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/27_Mon_RandomLab_Orbit.git
